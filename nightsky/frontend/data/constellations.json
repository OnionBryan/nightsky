In gratitude, Zeus later placed both nurses among the stars.

Hera had received the apple tree as a wedding gift when she married Zeus and planted it on the slopes of Mount Atlas, setting the Hesperides (daughters of Atlas) to guard it. When they proved untrustworthy, Hera placed the sleepless dragon Ladon around the tree. As one of his twelve labors, Heracles was tasked with stealing the golden apples. He either slew Ladon himself or tricked Atlas into fetching the apples while he temporarily held up the sky. Hera, grieving for her faithful guardian, placed Ladon among the stars. In the sky, the dragon is depicted with one foot of Heracles (the neighboring constellation Hercules) planted firmly upon its head. An alternative myth from Hyginus identifies Draco as one of the Gigantes who fought against the Olympian gods. The goddess Athena killed it and hurled it into the sky, where it became twisted and froze at the cold north celestial pole before it could right itself.",

The name camelopardalis combines the Greek kamelos (camel) and pardalis (leopard)—the ancients' name for the giraffe, which they thought combined a camel's long neck with a leopard's spots. Some sources suggest Plancius intended to represent the camel that Rebecca rode to meet Isaac in the Book of Genesis, though this connection is not firmly established.

An alternative (or additional) mythology connects it to the Argonaut expedition: Jason sent a white dove through the Clashing Rocks (Symplegades) to test if the Argo could pass.

This 'Great Eruption' may have been triggered by a triple-star merger. The ejected material formed the Homunculus Nebula, a bipolar cloud expanding at 650 km/s. Eta Carinae is considered the best candidate for the next supernova (possibly hypernova) in our galaxy. When it explodes, it may briefly rival the full Moon."

Returning from a lucrative concert tour of Sicily, Arion's crew plotted to kill him and steal his winnings. He asked to sing one final song. His music was so beautiful it attracted a school of dolphins. When the sailors attacked, Arion leaped overboard—and a dolphin carried him safely to shore.

This upset the cosmic order: Hades complained that the underworld was losing customers, and Zeus feared humans might become immortal. Zeus struck Asclepius dead with a thunderbolt. In grief and rage, Apollo killed the Cyclopes who forged the thunderbolt, for which Zeus nearly banished Apollo to Tartarus. Eventually, Zeus placed Asclepius in the sky to honor his healing gifts.

The Ottomans, who had besieged Vienna for two months with 150,000 troops, were routed by Sobieski's 'Winged Hussars' cavalry and allied forces totaling only 40,000. This battle is often considered a turning point that ended Ottoman expansion into Central Europe. Hevelius had personal reasons for gratitude: Sobieski had helped rebuild his observatory after it was destroyed by fire in 1679. The constellation represents Sobieski's coat of arms (the Janina arms), not a military shield. The name was later shortened to simply 'Scutum.'",

It has a yellow companion visible in telescopes, and the color contrast between the orange-red primary and greenish secondary is striking.
